# 📝 TODO app – JavaScript Mid-Level Skills Showcase

## 🚀 About the Project  
This **To-Do application** is built using **vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**, designed to showcase my skills at a **mid-level JavaScript developer** standard. It covers key aspects of modern frontend development, including:
✅ **DOM manipulation** – Adding, removing, and updating tasks dynamically

✔️ Add and delete tasks
✔️ Mark tasks as completed
✔️ Store tasks in `localStorage` for persistence
✔️ Filter tasks (todo / in progress / done)

🛠 **Dark Mode** – Toggle between light and dark themes  
🛠 **Task Prioritization** – Set high/medium/low priority levels  
🛠 **Drag & Drop** – Reorder tasks dynamically
